# Regex Tutorial 
***

## Summary
***
This code can be used to match emails that follow a standard format. It uses regex components such as “@” and “.” to identify the necessary parts of an email address. It also looks for things like a username and domain name in the address. This code can be used to validate an email address to make sure it follows the correct format. This can help prevent users from entering incorrect information into forms.

Matching Email:
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
